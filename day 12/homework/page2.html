    <h1>Hello and welcome to the Rugby page!</h1>
<em>Rugby, is a sport that many people don't know.Some call the sport American Football because of it's similarity in the rules and the number of players.</em>
<P>In Rugby, there are 22-23 players in each club but the diffrence between Football and Rugby is that in Football, there are 11 players in the starting lineup,but in Rugby there are 15 players in the lineup and 7-8 of them are on the bench.</P>
<P>In my country, Georgia, Rugby is a huge sport and we are actualy ranked 12th in the world just behind Wales, so you could say that we are good at it. In Georgia,we actually say that "Rugby is our sport" or " რაგბი ჩვენი სპორტია" to remind ourselves that we are one of the strongest in the world.. </P>
<strong>Rugby is also a really rough sport so before you take up this sport, you should think twice.</strong>
